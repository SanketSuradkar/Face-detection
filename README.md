# Face Detection Tool using Python

A simple and efficient face detection tool built using Python and OpenCV.

**Features**

* Detects faces in images and videos
* Supports multiple face detection algorithms (e.g. Haar Cascade, Dlib, OpenCV)
* Includes a GUI interface for easy use
* Can be integrated with other projects and applications

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SanketSuradkar/Face-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy pillow`
3. Run the GUI application: `python face_d.py`
4. Use the GUI interface to select an image or video file, and the tool will detect and display the faces.

**Technical Details**

* Built using Python 3.x and OpenCV 4.x
* Uses Haar Cascade, Dlib, and OpenCV face detection algorithms
* Includes a GUI interface built using Tkinter
* Supports image and video files (e.g. PNG, JPEG, MP4, AVI)

**Modules Used**

* `cv2`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks
* `tk`: Tkinter library for building the GUI interface
* `filedialog`: Tkinter module for file dialog functionality
* `PIL` (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing and manipulation
